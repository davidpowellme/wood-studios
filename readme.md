##Style Tiles
Style tiles are a middle point between a "mood board" and a full-scale mockup. In the 3 PSDs I uploaded, you can see sample color palettes, typefaces, and images that I drew inspiration for the design from.

Please keep in mind that if you like a color palette on one style tile but the typeface on a different one, we can mix and match these. Nothing is in stone yet.

I chose mostly sans-serif fonts for a modern, minimalist, clean feeling. The color palettes I wanted to keep toned-down enough to not make you look like a sketchers commercial but still give us a good range of color for options in the design.

##Mockup
This is ultra-simple because knowing which Risotto version you liked best made me stick mostly with that layout. I attempted to answer the questions I thought were most urgent on the homepage, and then link to more information on each. This is what I thought users would want to know immediately (correct me if I'm wrong):

1. Who's teaching my kid? (Mission statement & link to about/teacher bios)
2. What do you teach and how much does it cost? (Link to lessons & rates page)
3. Where are you? (location and possibly a link to full contact page)
